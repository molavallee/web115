        <h4>U.S. Snow Sculpting Competition</h4>
        <article>Lake Geneva's annual Winterfest and U.S. Snow Sculpting Competition attracts ice sculptors from around the country for this 3 day event. The artists sculpt their pieces on the grounds of the famed Riviera(Driehaus Plaza) in downtown Lake Geneva, on the shore of beautiful Geneva Lake, and also in Flat Iron Park, just SE of the plaza. 
            <p>The sculpting begins on Wednesday morning (2/3) and continues through Saturday morning (2/6) at 11a.m., when all sculptures are required to be completed.
                Saturday at 3p.m. the judges will award the victors. The Champion, which goes on to a worldwide competition, as well as Second and Third place are all acknowledged.</p>
